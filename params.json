  "body": "### Welcome to ocularium.\r\nOcularium is a simple Object Constraint Language tool that lets you create, export, import and edit constraints. This is a work in-progress plug-in for Astah Professional [Astah site](http://astah.net).\r\n\r\n### Object Constraint Language\r\nThe Object Constraint Language (OCL) is a base for many formal software engineering approaches. Proposed by Object Management Group, the language allows the designer to add constraints to a Unified Modeling Language (UML) model. OCL allows a more precise modelling, and can be used to express design by contract, testing, and even formal program verification, using appropriate tools. Ocularium allow the designer to better see (visualize) constraints inside and outside Astah. Ocularium means eye-glass. By exporting constraints as a plain text, external tools can be used to reason about constraints. Also, a single text is nice to edit and print.  \r\n\r\n### Road Map\r\nThis release of ocularium allows only to export all constraints to a single plain text file. Future releases are planned to allow to edit and import constraints. Also, we are looking forward to integrate with other tools and languages as Alloy, Java Modeling Language, and Isabelle/HOL.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nMarco Mangan @masmangan is the original ocularium author (August 2016).\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with ocularium?
