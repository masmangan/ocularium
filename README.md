# ocularium
A simple tool for OCL constraints visualisation using Astah/JUDE.

# Examples

In order to test this tool, we need a valid model and constraints. The first example is from Warmer & Kleppe book: Royal & Loyal.

## Royal & Loyal from Warmer & Kleppe

There are two editions of the book with small differences, we adopted the second edition model.
The first edition is available through a local library. We got the second edition model from the Web.

Modeling Royal & Loyal, second edition, was a nice task to help us understand about the Astah tool.
Astah template is a Java template. In order to model, we need primitive types that are platform independent.

Object Management Group provide XMI files with primitive types and other Unified Modeling Language classifiers.
The files are model revision dependent, we adopted the revision 2.5 (current as August 2016).
